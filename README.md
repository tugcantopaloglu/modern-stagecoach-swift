# Modern Stagecoach
 Has some animations bugs lead to app crash but systems work. If I find some time I will fix this animation bug.

Update before lesson animation problem solved. I tried to took travels from an api but api doesn't work. It causes travelList is nil error. Can't update for manual travel list because I don't have time to update it. Other functionalities works fine.

-Pods and ALBus library used.

Known Bugs:
-sometimes onboarding screen doesn't show and after 5 sec app starts automatically.

-looking for more
